                <b>How is the R-value calculated?</b><br>
                First, the date of the infection must be determined. On average, it takes five days between an infection and a positive test result. However, this period can be shorter or longer. This is why we can only calculate with this estimate.<br>
                Second, one has to determine how many people were infected five days before the positive test result. Therefore five days of incubation time is an estimate. <br>
                In the last and final step, the number of people that could have been infected by the positive person is calculated by using the number of currently infectious people and the number of the daily reported infections. The result is the R-value. 
                <br><br>
                <b>How is the 7-day-incidence calculated?</b><br>
                The calculation of the 7-day incidence is based on the reporting date, i.e., the date on which the local health department became aware of the case and recorded it electronically. For today's 7-day incidence, cases with reporting dates during the last 7 days are summed up. The current day is not included, just the last 7 days.<br>
                To make the 7-day-incidence comparable one has to put the summed up number in relation. The total number of the 7-day-incidence has to be divided by the total number of residents multiplied by 100,000.<br>
                I.e. on average 30 positive cases daily over the last 7 days means a 210 7-day-incidence number, given 150,000 residents in this region the 7-day-incidence-value is 210/1,5 = 140.
